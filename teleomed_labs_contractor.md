## Overview

Teleomed Labs is a small development group that specializes in healthcare solutions for vulnerable populations, including low-income seniors, veterans, and people in developing nations. We are currently working on web-based tools to help social workers and care coordinators manage care for vulnerable seniors and identify those at-risk for a variety of life-threatening conditions.

We are looking for an experienced contractor (full-time or part) to join our backend team. You'll be working on things like notifications (SMS/email), activity streams, fine-grained user permissions, search/autocomplete, caching, and chat. Our backend uses the latest Django, hosted on Heroku with a Postgres backend. Our front-end communicates with the backend entirely via JSON API, so no HTML/CSS or UI/UX experience is required.

## Requirements

* Fluency in Python and at least one Python web framework (eg. Django, Flask) 
* Self-directed with excellent English communication skills
* Experience working remotely in the past
* Experience with Git/GitHub and modern development practices (pull requests, code reviews, TDD, etc.)
* 5+ years of programming experience (internships included), at least 2 years with Python


## Preferred

* Experience designing and building JSON APIs
* Experience integrating third-party services (Twilio, PubNub, S3, etc.)
* An interest in healthcare or security


## Why work with us?

* Work remotely from anywhere in the world
* We are a small, easy-going team with very few meetings or rigid processes
* Flex your engineering muscles working on a modern stack (Django 1.10) with modern tools (AWS, Heroku, Slack, Github)
* Make a difference in the lives of thousands of elderly patients
